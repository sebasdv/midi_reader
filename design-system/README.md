# Embryo v4 Design System

This directory contains the visual and functional guidelines of the **Embryo v4** project. It is designed to be easily interpreted and reused by third-party applications.

## Contents

- `index.html`: An interactive, self-contained showcase of all design tokens, components, and animations.
- `logo_demo.svg`: Reference brand asset (located in `../public/`).

## How to use

1. **Standalone Documentation**: Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the design spec.
2. **Code Samples**: Every component in the showcase includes a "Copy Code" or "View Source" section to quickly integrate Embryo's aesthetic into your own project.
3. **Design Tokens**: Standardized CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography are defined at the top of the `index.html` file.

## Design Philosophy

The Embryo aesthetic is **Technical Mono-Chroma**:
- **Palette**: Pure Black & White with technical chromatic aberration (Magenta/Cyan).
- **Typography**: Monospaced fonts for a machine/terminal feel.
- **Interactions**: High-contrast, instantaneous, and tactile.
